# DogBot

**DogBot** is an early-stage AI project that helps dog owners understand problematic behavior through instinct theory, emotional intelligence, and dialogue — powered by GPT-4 and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

It is designed as an interactive coach that simulates the dog's perspective, asks meaningful questions, and helps humans reframe behavior with empathy. The system combines AI reasoning with structured data and behavior logic to support real change in human-canine relationships.
